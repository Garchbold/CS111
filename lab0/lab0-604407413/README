	The lab0.c file works by using getopt_long in a while loop in order to accept all of the possible options. Each option is listed in the long_options. There are four options. The first is --input which requires an argument and allows the user to specify a file as standard input. The second is --output which requires an argument and allows the user to specify a file as standard output. These two commands do this by calling open and dup to change the file descriptor. The third is --segfault which forces a segmentation fault. The fourth is --catch which catches the segmentation fault using a signal handler. The while loop runs until there are no more options then after all the flags and options are registered. Then at the end it reads from file descriptor 0 and prints everything to file descriptor 1.
	I included two screenshots. The first is segfault.png and it shows the value of the buffer to be null at the point of the break. The second is breakpoint.png and it shows where the breakpoint occurs and its backtrace. The Makefile includes all the standard compilation calls and dependencies to build the lab0 executable. In the make check I am looking at two main behaviors, when the program works and when the program fails. In the first check I make two files using the touch command. Then I cat hello to the input file, and run the program with the input and ouput option. I check to make sure the it accepted the correct file as input and wrote to the correct file by calling diff on the two files to make sure they are the same. This is the check to make sure the program works and does what it should. The second third and fourth check all run the program and check the exit status for the --input= command, the --output= command, and the --catch flag. If they are what they are expected to be then the makefile continues checking and if not it returns a make check error.
