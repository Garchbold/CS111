   For this lab I included many libraries. I included these libraries to give me access to the
standard c functions, termios, signals and handlers, threads, process forking, socket
communication, data encryption, port specification, and options parsing. My server and client
files include a list of global variables, a set of helper functions and then after comes my
main. The helper functions control the terminal settings, execute thread functions, handle
signals, and make error calls easier. Both files include two options, --encrypt to apply my
encrytion key and algorithm to the data, and --port to specify the port number by which the
two will communicate. The client has a third option, --log= which allows all the data
communication between the client and the server to be recorded in a specified file.

	 The client file sets up its end of the socket, and then creates two thread to deal
with communication between the keyboard and the socket, and the socket and the terminal. The
server file sets up its end of the socket, and then forks into two processes creating one child
that runs a bash shell. It creates and connects the pipes between the parent process and the
child. In the parent it creates two threads to deal with communication between the shell and the
terminal. During the communication between the socket and the pipes, there are if statements
that check for certain cases where the program is to exit with a certain return code.

     I would like to use one slip day for this lab allowing me to turn it in before midnight of Tuesday April 19th. Thanks you.
